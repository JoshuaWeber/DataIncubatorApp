    "# Food Pilgrim\n",
    "## Overview\n",
    "Food Pilgrim is a web application to generate a list of destinations in a specific region that will delight a user. Every city has specific types of food that it is known for. Food Pilgrim will take advantag of this to identify the local specialities and recommend a set of locations to experience them yourself.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Backing Data\n",
    "Primary source of data will be twitter comments. By mining twitter comments we can identify trends in locales about specific types of food. Relying on the assumption that popular local food types will get talked about more frequently on twitter by local users. We will be able to train a system to extract this local specialities from twitter data.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Current Status\n",
    "Initial validation of this project has been completed. A small twitter sample set has been downloaded in 5 sample cities. An analysis was performed to valid the assumption that local special food items will have a high hit rate for local twitter users. Initial progress has been started to explore techniques for creating an automated system to extract local specialities for all cities."
